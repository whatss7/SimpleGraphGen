# SimpleGraphGen

## Introduction

This is a simple graph generation library mainly for myself to use, so this repo contains:

- few comments
- no test unit
- no type check

Despite its vulnerability, this is a handful library (at least for me).

This library can generate **UML Class Diagrams** and **Flow Diagrams**, implemented by `umlGen.UmlCreator` and `flowgen.FlowCreator`.

More details could be found in `example.py`.

## Dependency

This library depends on `graphviz` and `graphviz` python package. (Yes, they are different things.)

Install graphviz on [https://graphviz.org/](https://graphviz.org/) and install python package by executing `pip install graphviz`.
